# Nuxt Block Module

This module provides a way to define blocks in Nuxt templates, allowing them to be dynamically overridden elsewhere. It is fully compatible with **Nuxt Layers**.

## ‚ú® Features

- Define blocks in templates and override them dynamically.
- Use a **condition** (implemented as a composable) to determine whether a component should be loaded.
- Inspired by Twig's block system, bringing similar functionality to Nuxt.
- Future improvements:
  - Support for **nested block overrides** (currently, a block can only be overridden once).
  - **Dynamic lazy loading** of composables for better performance (if feasible).

## üöÄ Installation

Install the module to your Nuxt application with one command:

```sh
npx nuxi module add @wineworlds/nuxt-block
```

That's it! You can now use Nuxt Block in your Nuxt app ‚ú®

## üîß Configuration

In your `nuxt.config.ts`, register the module and specify the block directory:

```ts
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url'
import { dirname, join } from 'path'

const currentDir = dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url))

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  module: ['@wineworlds/nuxt-block'],
  block: {
    blocks: [
      join(currentDir, 'blocks'),
    ],
  },
})
```

## üìÇ Block Mapping

Define your block mappings in a `mapping.json` file inside the `blocks/` directory. The **condition** property is optional:

```json
{
  "logo": {
    "component": "./Logo/logo.vue",
    "condition": "./Logo/condition.ts"
  }
}
```

The specified files should also be located within the `blocks/` directory.

## üõ† Usage

Once configured, you can use the `<Block>` component anywhere in your templates:

```vue
<Block name="logo" />
```

or provide a fallback content:

```vue
<Block name="logo">
  <NuxtImg src="/logo.png" alt="Logo" />
</Block>
```

## üèó Future Enhancements

- **Nested overrides**: Allow blocks to be overridden multiple times in a hierarchy.
- **Lazy loading of composables**: Improve performance by dynamically loading only required composables.
